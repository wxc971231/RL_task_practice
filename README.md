# About this repository

- I decided to upload all my RL task demo here, include
  1. Project code written while learning
  2. Code written for some competition
  3. Anything about RL task... I don‘t know
- Anyway, I hope every project here is complete, and can be run or train directly to solve an individual RL task
- The project name will follow this format: `[env_name] task_name (method_name/method_type)`
